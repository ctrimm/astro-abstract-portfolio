## DISRUPTIVE_RETAIL

Traditional e-commerce is boring. We injected calculated chaos into the buying experience. Product images degrade quality as you scroll. The "Buy" button moves when you try to click it too fast.

### METRICS

*   **Conversion Rate**: -15% (But brand loyalty up 200%)
*   **Bounce Rate**: 80% (Only the strong survive)

## VISUAL_LANGUAGE

Inspired by corrupted JPEGs and VHS static.
